# Recommendation-System
Build a recommendation system for Amazon using customer review data to suggest products based on past ratings. Implement collaborative filtering to enhance personalization, improve user engagement, and optimize shopping experiences with accurate, scalable recommendations.
# Amazon Product Recommendation System

## Overview
With the exponential growth of information, consumers face an overload of choices. Recommender systems help by providing personalized product suggestions, enhancing user experience, and driving business growth. This project aims to build a recommendation system for Amazon using customer review data.

## Objective
To develop a recommendation model that suggests relevant products to users based on their past interactions and ratings. This will enhance personalization, improve user engagement, and optimize shopping experiences.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of Amazon product reviews, including:
- User ID
- Product ID
- Ratings
- Reviews
- Timestamps

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming raw data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding rating distributions and user behavior.
3. **Collaborative Filtering:** Implementing item-to-item and user-to-user recommendation models.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Comparing performance using RMSE and accuracy metrics.
5. **Deployment:** Integrating the model for real-time recommendations.

## Models Used
- **Baseline Model:** Simple popularity-based recommendation.
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Item-to-item and user-based approaches.
- **Matrix Factorization:** Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for optimized recommendations.

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aditi1778/Recommendation-System.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Results & Insights
- Improved recommendation accuracy with collaborative filtering.
- Personalized product suggestions enhance user experience.
- Scalable model suitable for large datasets.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement deep learning-based recommendations.
- Improve model efficiency with hybrid filtering.
- Deploy as a real-time service using APIs.
